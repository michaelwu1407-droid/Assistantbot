## How the doc set fits together

This matrix is the **data**. The conceptual framework lives in two
short companion files — don't restate them here, link to them.

| File | Role | Don't duplicate it; reference it |
|------|------|----------------------------------|
| `JOURNEY_ACCEPTANCE.md` | The 8-check journey gate (D · A · C · O · 🧠 · ↪ · 🛡 · 📋) | Definitions of each gate |
| `FEATURE_VERIFICATION.md` | The 4-layer proof model (Behavior · Delivery · Observability · Live-proof) | Status semantics (verified / watch / gap) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Cross-cutting product + design policies (tradie load, Tracey-number identity, design tokens, typography, currency/date format, focus rings, empty-state, dialog sizing, mobile rules) | Every cross-cutting "do" / "don't" — those are already canonical there |
| `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` | The 7-layer technical testing strategy (unit → e2e) | Technical test patterns |
| `docs/missing_features.md` | Curated list of not-built-yet items | Build/no-build decisions |
| `APP_FEATURES.md` | Feature inventory — what exists today | Capability claims |
| `CRM_PAGE_AUDIT.md` | Per-page CRM audit history | Page-by-page narrative |

Any prose that previously lived in `docs/CRITICAL_USER_JOURNEYS.md` or
`docs/use_case_walkthroughs.md` has been folded into the per-row notes
below. Those files now point here instead of duplicating the data.

## Cell vocabulary

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ | Verified — gate passes today, with proof |
| 🟡 | Watch — works but one signal is partial (no automated test, or one edge case unknown) |
| 🔴 | Gap — known failing or actively wrong behaviour |
| ⬜ | Not built — surface exists but this gate has never been wired up |
| ➖ | Not applicable to this surface |

## Row format

Each row scores the 8 `JOURNEY_ACCEPTANCE.md` gates plus a Status
rollup. Columns:

```
| ID | Surface | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes / Proof |
```

Status rollup:
- **verified** — every cell ✅ or ➖
- **watch** — at least one 🟡, no 🔴, no ⬜
- **gap** — any 🔴 or ⬜ on a gate that matters

**Important:** cross-cutting `CLAUDE.md` policies (design tokens,
mobile-fit, owner-vs-teammate gating, en-AU formatting, currency
format, focus ring, empty-state pattern) are implicit acceptance gates
for every row. If a row otherwise meets the 8 gates but violates a
`CLAUDE.md` policy, it cannot be ✅ — drop it to 🟡 and link the
specific policy violated in *Notes*.

## How to use this matrix

| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Before merging a PR | Find every row your diff touches. Keep it ✅ or explicitly flip to 🟡 / 🔴 with a note. Reviewers reject silent degradation. |
| At release time | Walk every 👁 (manual-only) cell in the release scope. Anything 🔴 is a blocker unless explicitly accepted by the release manager. |
| When a bug is found in prod | Add or update the row, drop the failing gate to 🔴, then fix-forward with the test that would have caught it. |
| Every quarter | Walk every ⬜ row. Decide: build it, or remove from matrix. Backlog rot is worse than honest gaps. |

## High-risk findings from the May 2026 audit

These rows are 🔴 today and are duplicated inline below — pulled to
the top so they don't get lost in the grid.

| ID | Surface | The lie | Fix path |
|----|---------|---------|----------|
| cpl-01 | Inbound SMS "STOP" | ✅ **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `Contact.smsOptedOut` added; STOP/UNSUBSCRIBE/CANCEL exits early before AI reply, sends confirmation SMS, blocks further AI replies to opted-out contacts. START re-subscribes. | `app/api/twilio/webhook/route.ts` + `prisma/schema.prisma` + migration. |
| cpl-02 | Subscription cancel | ✅ **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `customer.subscription.deleted` now calls `twilioMasterClient.incomingPhoneNumbers(sid).remove()` and nulls workspace Twilio columns. | `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`. |
| notif-01..03 | Email pref toggles | ✅ **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `shouldSendNotificationEmail()` helper added. `emailNewContacts` fires on `createContact`; `emailDealUpdates` fires on `updateDealStage`. `emailWeeklySummary` toggle disabled with "(coming soon)" label. | `actions/notification-actions.ts`, `lib/owner-notification-email.ts`, `contact-actions.ts`, `deal-actions.ts`. |
| bill-10 | Grace period on cancel | ✅ **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `app/crm/layout.tsx` now treats `"canceled"` + `stripeCurrentPeriodEnd > now` as still entitled. | `app/crm/layout.tsx`. |
| crm-10, crm-11, crm-17, comm-11, ai-05 | Kanban drag, stale→quoted drag-modal, Ctrl+K search, bulk SMS via chat, ambiguous AI fallback | comm-11/ai-05 ✅ **FIXED** — `listDeals` tool now accepts optional keyword filter enabling "find indoor work" queries. crm-10/11/17 pending. | `lib/ai/tools.ts` + `chat-actions.ts`. |

## A. Acquisition surfaces (`acq`)

Public-facing pages — pre-signup or unauthenticated. Every row must

## B. Auth, session & account lifecycle (`auth`)

Multiple competing auth surfaces (`/auth/*` and `/(auth)/*`) — see the
B-meta row below. CC-4 (mobile) and CC-6 (reassuring loading copy)
critical here.

| ID | Surface | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes |

## C. Onboarding & first-run (`onb`)

Pulled from `docs/CRITICAL_USER_JOURNEYS.md` §3 — that file's content
is folded into the rows below. Three critical sequencing details
(billing-then-setup-then-tutorial, Twilio provisioning outcome surface,
resume mid-flow) are scored individually.

## F. Modals & dialogs (`modal`)

Per `CLAUDE.md` "Dialogs & modals" rule: every modal uses `ott-dialog`
base (viewport-relative width + `max-h-[90vh]`) and a per-modal
`max-w-[Xpx]`. Mobile-fit + a11y checks apply universally.

Legal-exposure cluster. These are the audit's top fix items.

## U. Resilience & failure modes (`res`)

Cross-cutting failure simulations. Each row asks: when X breaks, does
the tradie see a sensible message and can ops see the failure?

| ID | Failure mode | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes |

## V. Logic & intuitiveness review (`logic`)

This section captures **coherence problems** — surfaces that
technically work but mislead the user. Per `JOURNEY_ACCEPTANCE.md` gate
🧠 (Coherence) these are the most insidious because passing the
*Behavior* layer of `FEATURE_VERIFICATION.md` is not enough.

| ID | Coherence concern | Status | Notes |
|----|--------------------|--------|-------|
| logic-01 | **Duplicate route trees** for the same task (`/auth/*` vs `/(auth)/*`, `/crm/contacts/[id]` vs `/contacts/[id]`, `/crm/inbox` vs `/inbox`) | gap | Tradie gets sent to one but bookmarks the other. Pick one canonical path per task and redirect the rest. See auth-meta, crm-12, crm-29. |
| logic-02 | **`/crm/settings/privacy` vs `/crm/settings/data-privacy`** | gap | Two overlapping settings pages — which is canonical? Consolidate. See set-10 / set-18. |
| logic-03 | **`/crm/hub` is a 404 but appears wired in nav** | gap | Either build the hub or remove the link target. See crm-35. |
| logic-04 | **`/crm/design/*` is publicly reachable by any signed-in user** | gap | Internal-only pages should be staff-gated (`adm-01` pattern). See crm-40. |
| logic-05 | **Email pref toggles save but do nothing** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — emailDealUpdates + emailNewContacts now enforced. Weekly summary toggle disabled. |
| logic-06 | **Customer STOP gets an AI reply** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — STOP exits early, no AI reply. See cpl-01. |
| logic-07 | **Stripe Manage button bounces tradie off-app without warning** | gap | The first thing a tradie sees after clicking "Manage" is a different brand. No confirmation, no save-the-customer step. See bill-02, bill-09. |
| logic-08 | **Immediate lockout on cancel even though they paid for the month** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — Grace period honoured in CRM layout. |
| logic-09 | **Twilio number kept billable on cancelled workspaces** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — Number released on customer.subscription.deleted. |
| logic-10 | **Kanban drag does nothing** | gap | Affordance suggests drag-to-move; reality is silent failure. See crm-19. |
| logic-11 | **Stale-deal drag → expected follow-up modal doesn't open** | gap | The drag is the implicit promise of automation. See crm-20. |
| logic-12 | **Ctrl+K returns "No results" for known data** | gap | Power-user shortcut feels broken; users lose trust in search globally. See crm-39. |
| logic-13 | **Department selection on `/contact` is decorative** | gap | If routing isn't different per department, the field is a confidence-eroding ask. See acq-09. |
| logic-14 | **Calendar event click navigates to deal page** | gap | User expected a popover; navigation kicks them out of their planning context. See cal-05. |
| logic-15 | **AI fails open-ended request without graceful "I can't do that yet"** | gap | UC2 "find me indoor work" — user can't tell if the AI is broken or just refusing. See ai-05. |
| logic-16 | **Multilingual onboarding toggle reads like preference but is a runtime switch** | gap | If a caller speaks another language, the toggle must be strict at runtime. See voice-08. |
| logic-17 | **Auth has two entry-point trees** | gap | See logic-01 / auth-meta. |
| logic-18 | **"22-row settings index" without grouping or search** | gap | At 22 subroutes the index page violates CC-1 (cognitive load). Group by domain: Account / Comms / AI / Billing / Workspace / Data & Privacy / Help. See set-01. |
| logic-19 | **Onboarding "resume after browser close" lands silently** | gap | No "Welcome back, here's where you were" copy. See onb-15. |
| logic-20 | **Loading states without reassurance copy** | gap | Per CLAUDE.md CC-6, "Calling Tracey now…" not blank spinner. Audit every `loading.tsx` + Suspense fallback. |

## W. Mobile-fit pass (`mob`)

Per `CLAUDE.md` CC-4 ("Tracey visual identity"), the app must run on
iPhone 13 viewport and 768px tablet. This pass tracks which areas
have been driven on mobile.

| ID | Area | iPhone 13 | Tablet | Notes |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| mob-01 | Homepage + hero callback | ✅ | ✅ | Visual specs cover both viewports. |
| mob-02 | `/pricing`, `/contact` | ✅ | ✅ | Same. |
| mob-03 | `/crm/dashboard` chat mode | ✅ | ✅ | Bottom-nav Tracey button — one entry point. |
| mob-04 | `/crm/inbox` composer | ✅ | 🟡 | Tablet split-view unverified. |
| mob-05 | `/crm/deals` kanban | 🟡 | 🟡 | Kanban broken on desktop (crm-19); mobile usability not separately tested. |
| mob-06 | `/crm/schedule` Open Job Mode bottom sheet | ✅ | 🟡 | Tradie field flow primary mobile path. |
| mob-07 | Modals (full deal-detail, new-deal) | 🟡 | 🟡 | Mobile-fit per `ott-dialog` rule; audit by modal pending. |
| mob-08 | Settings index + 22 subroutes | 🔴 | 🟡 | CC-4 risk — 22 subroutes without grouping is bad on mobile. See logic-18. |

## X. Action items (rollup of every 🔴 / ⬜)

In approximate fix-priority order. Each lands with the test that
would have caught it (rule below).

### Compliance & money (do first)

1. **cpl-01 / comm-19** — SMS STOP. Implement opt-out flag + short-circuit + confirmation SMS + outbound block. ~30 lines in webhook + `Contact.smsOptedOut` migration + send-side guard. Tests: `e2e/sms-stop-opt-out.spec.ts` (existing stubs).
2. **cpl-02 / bill-04** — Twilio release on subscription cancel. Schedule release job for `stripeCurrentPeriodEnd`. Tests: `e2e/subscription-cancellation.spec.ts`.
3. **cpl-03..05 / notif-01..03** — Wire `shouldSendEmail(workspaceId, prefKey)` into every email sender. Tests: `e2e/notification-pref-enforcement.spec.ts`.
4. **bill-10** — Grace period through `current_period_end`. ~5 lines in `app/crm/layout.tsx`.
5. **bill-09 / bill-11 / bill-12** — In-app cancel UI: confirmation dialog, post-cancel banner, data-export offer.
6. **cpl-06 / cpl-07** — Customer data export + workspace deletion UX.
7. **cpl-08** — Outbound customer-email unsubscribe footer.

### Coherence (do next — these are user-trust bombs)

8. **logic-01 / auth-meta / crm-12 / crm-29** — Collapse duplicate route trees.
9. **logic-02 / set-10 / set-18** — Pick one privacy settings page.
10. **logic-03 / crm-35** — `/crm/hub` build or remove.
11. **logic-04 / crm-40** — Staff-gate `/crm/design/*`.
12. **logic-18 / set-01** — Group the 22 settings subroutes.
13. **logic-10 / crm-19, crm-20** — Fix kanban drag + stale-deal drag follow-up.
14. **logic-12 / crm-39 / modal-12** — Fix Ctrl+K search.
15. **logic-15 / ai-05 / comm-11** — AI graceful fallback for ambiguous requests.

### Reliability / observability (do alongside)

16. **voice-08** — Multilingual runtime switch + synthetic canary.
17. **pub-01 / pub-06** — Portal-open audit trail + portal-link presence audit.
18. **comm-17** — Booking-confirmation last-success/failure ops row.
19. **comm-20** — WhatsApp round-trip synthetic.
20. **res-01, res-02, res-04, res-05, res-07, res-08** — Failure-mode coverage.

### Cleanup / UX polish

21. **set-** rows marked watch — add at least one assertion per subroute.
22. **modal-09, modal-11, modal-14, modal-15, modal-16** — A11y / unit specs.
23. **logic-20** — Audit every `loading.tsx` + Suspense fallback for CC-6 reassurance copy.

## Y. Execution rules (do not skip)

These are the rules every PR is held to. They are the reason the
matrix is worth maintaining.

1. **Every PR updates this matrix.** If your diff touches a row's
   area, either keep its state, improve it, or flip it to 🔴 with a
   note. Reviewers reject PRs that silently degrade rows.
2. **Every bug fix lands with the test that would have caught it.**
   The test goes in the matrix row's *Proof* column.
3. **Pre-release smoke pass.** The release manager walks every 👁
   (manual-only) cell in the release scope. Anything 🔴 is a blocker
   unless explicitly accepted in writing.
4. **Quarterly cull.** Walk every ⬜ row. Decide: build it or remove
   from the matrix. Backlog rot is worse than honest gaps.
5. **A row cannot be ✅ if it violates a `CLAUDE.md` cross-cutting
   policy** (design tokens, mobile-fit, owner-vs-teammate gating,
   en-AU date/time, formatCurrency, focus ring, empty-state pattern).
   Drop to 🟡 and link the violated policy in *Notes*.
6. **A row cannot be ✅ on `📋 Proof` if its only evidence is a unit
   test of a helper.** The proof must include either an E2E /
   integration test that drives the surface or an ops observability
   row (`/admin/customer-usage`).

## Z. Change log

- **2026-05-24** — Audit: cpl-01 (STOP), cpl-02 (Twilio leak),
  notif-01..03 (decorative email prefs), bill-10 (no grace period),
  logic-01..20 (coherence problems). Three Playwright stubs added.
  Matrix consolidated with `JOURNEY_ACCEPTANCE.md` 8-check framework.
  Folded prose from `docs/CRITICAL_USER_JOURNEYS.md` and
  `docs/use_case_walkthroughs.md` into per-row notes.
