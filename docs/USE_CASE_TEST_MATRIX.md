## How the doc set fits together

This matrix is the **data**. The conceptual framework lives in two
short companion files — don't restate them here, link to them.

| File | Role | Don't duplicate it; reference it |
|------|------|----------------------------------|
| `JOURNEY_ACCEPTANCE.md` | The 8-check journey gate (D · A · C · O · 🧠 · ↪ · 🛡 · 📋) | Definitions of each gate |
| `FEATURE_VERIFICATION.md` | The 4-layer proof model (Behavior · Delivery · Observability · Live-proof) | Status semantics (verified / watch / gap) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Cross-cutting product + design policies (tradie load, Tracey-number identity, design tokens, typography, currency/date format, focus rings, empty-state, dialog sizing, mobile rules) | Every cross-cutting "do" / "don't" — those are already canonical there |
| `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` | The 7-layer technical testing strategy (unit → e2e) | Technical test patterns |
| `docs/missing_features.md` | Curated list of not-built-yet items | Build/no-build decisions |
| `APP_FEATURES.md` | Feature inventory — what exists today | Capability claims |
| `CRM_PAGE_AUDIT.md` | Per-page CRM audit history | Page-by-page narrative |

Any prose that previously lived in `docs/CRITICAL_USER_JOURNEYS.md` or
`docs/use_case_walkthroughs.md` has been folded into the per-row notes
below. Those files now point here instead of duplicating the data.

## Cell vocabulary

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ | Verified — gate passes today, with proof |
| 🟡 | Watch — works but one signal is partial (no automated test, or one edge case unknown) |
| 🔴 | Gap — known failing or actively wrong behaviour |
| ⬜ | Not built — surface exists but this gate has never been wired up |
| ➖ | Not applicable to this surface |

## Row format

Each row scores the 8 `JOURNEY_ACCEPTANCE.md` gates plus a Status
rollup. Columns:

```
| ID | Surface | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes / Proof |
```

Status rollup:
- **verified** — every cell ✅ or ➖
- **watch** — at least one 🟡, no 🔴, no ⬜
- **gap** — any 🔴 or ⬜ on a gate that matters

**Important:** cross-cutting `CLAUDE.md` policies (design tokens,
mobile-fit, owner-vs-teammate gating, en-AU formatting, currency
format, focus ring, empty-state pattern) are implicit acceptance gates
for every row. If a row otherwise meets the 8 gates but violates a
`CLAUDE.md` policy, it cannot be ✅ — drop it to 🟡 and link the
specific policy violated in *Notes*.

## How to use this matrix

| When | Do |
|------|-----|
| Before merging a PR | Find every row your diff touches. Keep it ✅ or explicitly flip to 🟡 / 🔴 with a note. Reviewers reject silent degradation. |
| At release time | Walk every 👁 (manual-only) cell in the release scope. Anything 🔴 is a blocker unless explicitly accepted by the release manager. |
| When a bug is found in prod | Add or update the row, drop the failing gate to 🔴, then fix-forward with the test that would have caught it. |
| Every quarter | Walk every ⬜ row. Decide: build it, or remove from matrix. Backlog rot is worse than honest gaps. |

## High-risk findings from the May 2026 audit

These rows are 🔴 today and are duplicated inline below — pulled to
the top so they don't get lost in the grid.

| ID | Surface | The lie | Fix path |
|----|---------|---------|----------|
| cpl-01 | Inbound SMS "STOP" | ✅ **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `Contact.smsOptedOut` added; STOP/UNSUBSCRIBE/CANCEL exits early before AI reply, sends confirmation SMS, blocks further AI replies to opted-out contacts. START re-subscribes. | `app/api/twilio/webhook/route.ts` + `prisma/schema.prisma` + migration. |
| cpl-02 | Subscription cancel | ✅ **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `customer.subscription.deleted` now calls `twilioMasterClient.incomingPhoneNumbers(sid).remove()` and nulls workspace Twilio columns. | `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`. |
| notif-01..03 | Email pref toggles | ✅ **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `shouldSendNotificationEmail()` helper added. `emailNewContacts` fires on `createContact`; `emailDealUpdates` fires on `updateDealStage`. `emailWeeklySummary` toggle disabled with "(coming soon)" label. | `actions/notification-actions.ts`, `lib/owner-notification-email.ts`, `contact-actions.ts`, `deal-actions.ts`. |
| bill-10 | Grace period on cancel | ✅ **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `app/crm/layout.tsx` now treats `"canceled"` + `stripeCurrentPeriodEnd > now` as still entitled. | `app/crm/layout.tsx`. |
| crm-10, crm-11, crm-17, comm-11, ai-05 | Kanban drag, stale→quoted drag-modal, Ctrl+K search, bulk SMS via chat, ambiguous AI fallback | comm-11/ai-05 ✅ **FIXED** — `listDeals` tool now accepts optional keyword filter enabling "find indoor work" queries. crm-10/11/17 pending. | `lib/ai/tools.ts` + `chat-actions.ts`. |

## A. Acquisition surfaces (`acq`)

Public-facing pages — pre-signup or unauthenticated. Every row must
pass on mobile (CC-4) and warm-cream palette (CLAUDE.md homepage rule).

| ID | Surface | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--------|-------|

| acq-10 | `/solutions` index | ✅ | ➖ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | Manual only. |
| acq-11 | `/solutions/[slug]` (per-trade landing) | 🟡 | ➖ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | Discoverable only via direct links; slugs unverified at scale. |

| acq-17 | Demo voice call (`/api/demo-call`) | 🟡 | ➖ | 🟡 | 🟡 | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 | gap | `missing_features.md` "real voice signoff" — still needs live handset proof. |
| acq-18 | Public preview embed `/portal-preview` | ✅ | ➖ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | verified | `e2e/public-preview.spec.ts`. |

## B. Auth, session & account lifecycle (`auth`)

Multiple competing auth surfaces (`/auth/*` and `/(auth)/*`) — see the
B-meta row below. CC-4 (mobile) and CC-6 (reassuring loading copy)
critical here.

| ID | Surface | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--------|-------|

| auth-03 | `/auth/google-done` post-OAuth landing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | Copy generic; no E2E. |
| auth-04 | `/auth/auth-code-error` recovery | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — "Try again" calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` before redirecting to `/auth`, clearing stale cookie. |
| auth-05 | `/(auth)/login` Clerk-style page | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | Cross-references auth-meta. |
| auth-06 | `/(auth)/login/google` OAuth init | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | Manual only. |
| auth-07 | `/(auth)/signup` page | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | Cross-references auth-meta. |
| auth-08 | `/(auth)/signup/google` OAuth signup | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | Manual only. |
| auth-09 | `/(auth)/forgot-password` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | `e2e/auth-forgot-password.spec.ts` — form render + success message. Email delivery unverifiable in test environment (Supabase auth, no hook). |
| auth-10 | `/invite/join` teammate accept | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | verified | `e2e/team-member.spec.ts`. |
| auth-11 | `/api/auth/send-sms` OTP request | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | verified | `__tests__/sms-auth-routes.test.ts` — unconfigured provider 500, sends OTP + stores code, provider failure 500. |
| auth-12 | `/api/auth/verify-sms` OTP verify | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | verified | Same file — rejects invalid/expired codes; verifies valid code + removes after use. |
| auth-13 | Session refresh on protected page | ➖ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | `__tests__/middleware.test.ts` — `updateSession` is called for every protected page navigation. Mid-session action-layer refresh unverified (E2E gap). |
| auth-14 | Expired session mid-action recovery | ➖ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — CRM layout now redirects to `/auth?next=<path>` (middleware sets `x-pathname` header); `UnifiedAuth` redirects to `next` after login when user is already set up. |
| auth-15 | Sign out | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | verified | `__tests__/middleware.test.ts`. |
| auth-16 | Two-tab different workspaces | ➖ | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 | ⛔ | gap | No coverage. |
| auth-17 | User removed from workspace mid-session | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — `getDashboardShellState` pre-checks `User.workspaceId`; if null, CRM layout redirects to `/no-workspace` friendly page instead of /billing. |
| auth-18 | Role change live (owner promotes teammate) | ➖ | 🟡 | 🟡 | ✅ | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 | ⛔ | gap | Next page-load reflects, but no in-session reflection. |
| auth-19 | `/api/delete-user` account deletion | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🟡 | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — `DeleteWorkspaceButton` added to `/crm/settings/privacy`; type-to-confirm dialog, owner-only gate, signs out on success. |

## C. Onboarding & first-run (`onb`)

Pulled from `docs/CRITICAL_USER_JOURNEYS.md` §3 — that file's content
is folded into the rows below. Three critical sequencing details
(billing-then-setup-then-tutorial, Twilio provisioning outcome surface,
resume mid-flow) are scored individually.

## Q. Public-facing customer surfaces (`pub`)

These are URLs a customer (not the tradie) will hit.

| ID | Surface | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes |
|----|---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--------|-------|
| pub-01 | `/portal/[token]` public job portal | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | verified | `__tests__/job-portal-page.test.tsx` — renders SCHEDULED job for valid token; calls `notFound()` for invalid token. Audit trail: Activity "Job portal viewed" + `portal.opened` webhook (deduped 1 h). |

## R. Cron jobs & background work (`cron`)

Per `CLAUDE.md` CC-1 these never surface to the tradie. All called by
GitHub Actions; each must emit a heartbeat the ops page can read.

| ID | Cron path | Cadence | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes |

Internal-only. Should be 404 in prod for non-staff (CC-1, CC-2).

## T. Compliance, opt-out, data rights (`cpl`)

Legal-exposure cluster. These are the audit's top fix items.

| ID | Surface | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes |

## U. Resilience & failure modes (`res`)

Cross-cutting failure simulations. Each row asks: when X breaks, does
the tradie see a sensible message and can ops see the failure?

| ID | Failure mode | D | A | C | O | 🧠 | ↪ | 🛡 | 📋 | Status | Notes |
|----|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--------|-------|
| res-01 | Stripe API down during checkout | ➖ | ➖ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | watch | `__tests__/billing-actions.test.ts` — Stripe ETIMEDOUT propagates as thrown error; `UpgradeButton` catches it and shows toast "Could not start checkout — please try again in a moment." No retry backoff. |
| res-02 | Stripe webhook delayed/missed (worker outage) | ➖ | ➖ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⛔ | watch | `runIdempotent(event.id)` ensures Stripe retries (up to 3 days, per Stripe policy) are safe. `__tests__/stripe-webhook.test.ts` asserts 200 on duplicate. No manual backfill script. |

## V. Logic & intuitiveness review (`logic`)

This section captures **coherence problems** — surfaces that
technically work but mislead the user. Per `JOURNEY_ACCEPTANCE.md` gate
🧠 (Coherence) these are the most insidious because passing the
*Behavior* layer of `FEATURE_VERIFICATION.md` is not enough.

| ID | Coherence concern | Status | Notes |
|----|--------------------|--------|-------|
| logic-01 | **Duplicate route trees** for the same task (`/auth/*` vs `/(auth)/*`, `/crm/contacts/[id]` vs `/contacts/[id]`, `/crm/inbox` vs `/inbox`) | watch | All legacy routes now redirect to canonical `/auth`, `/crm/contacts/[id]`, `/crm/inbox`. See auth-meta, crm-12, crm-29. |
| logic-02 | **`/crm/settings/privacy` vs `/crm/settings/data-privacy`** | watch | `/data-privacy` redirects to `/privacy`; canonical is `/crm/settings/privacy`. See set-18. |
| logic-03 | **`/crm/hub` is a 404 but appears wired in nav** | watch | `app/crm/hub/page.tsx` redirects to `/crm/dashboard`. See crm-35. |
| logic-04 | **`/crm/design/*` is publicly reachable by any signed-in user** | watch | Both pages redirect to `/crm/dashboard` — no live sandbox UI exposed. See crm-40. |
| logic-05 | **Email pref toggles save but do nothing** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — emailDealUpdates + emailNewContacts now enforced. Weekly summary toggle disabled. |
| logic-06 | **Customer STOP gets an AI reply** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — STOP exits early, no AI reply. See cpl-01. |
| logic-07 | **Stripe Manage button bounces tradie off-app without warning** | watch | `CancelSubscriptionButton` now provides in-app cancel dialog (save-the-customer). "Manage" still opens Stripe portal — cross-brand UX is an acknowledged trade-off. See bill-09. |
| logic-08 | **Immediate lockout on cancel even though they paid for the month** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — Grace period honoured in CRM layout. |
| logic-09 | **Twilio number kept billable on cancelled workspaces** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — Number released on customer.subscription.deleted. |
| logic-10 | **Kanban drag does nothing** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — `dragStartColumnRef` set in `handleDragStart`; intra-column sort path now reached. See crm-19. |
| logic-11 | **Stale-deal drag → expected follow-up modal doesn't open** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — `StaleDealFollowUpModal` wired into `handleDragEnd`. See crm-20. |
| logic-12 | **Ctrl+K returns "No results" for known data** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — cmdk `shouldFilter={false}` fix. See crm-39. |
| logic-13 | **Department selection on `/contact` is decorative** | watch | **VERIFIED 2026-05-25** — `__tests__/contact-route.test.ts` confirms department appears as `[Contact – sales]` email subject prefix. No separate inbox routing — acceptable MVP. See acq-09. |
| logic-14 | **Calendar event click navigates to deal page** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — chip click opens Popover with call/SMS/open-details actions. See cal-05. |
| logic-15 | **AI fails open-ended request without graceful "I can't do that yet"** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-24** — `listDeals` keyword filter handles open-ended queries. See ai-05. |
| logic-16 | **Multilingual onboarding toggle reads like preference but is a runtime switch** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — `setReplyLanguage()` called at call start from grounding. See voice-08. |
| logic-17 | **Auth has two entry-point trees** | watch | `/login` and `/signup` redirect to `/auth`. See logic-01 / auth-meta. |
| logic-18 | **"22-row settings index" without grouping or search** | watch | Desktop sidebar grouped; mobile `SettingsIndexMobile` shows 10 icon+subtitle rows. See set-01. |
| logic-19 | **Onboarding "resume after browser close" lands silently** | watch | **FIXED 2026-05-25** — "Welcome back!" bubble shown when workspace name is non-default. See onb-15. |
| logic-20 | **Loading states without reassurance copy** | watch | Existing `loading.tsx` files all include "Loading your pipeline…" / contacts / jobs copy. Specific voice-call states not separately audited. |

## W. Mobile-fit pass (`mob`)

Per `CLAUDE.md` CC-4 ("Tracey visual identity"), the app must run on
iPhone 13 viewport and 768px tablet. This pass tracks which areas
have been driven on mobile.

| ID | Area | iPhone 13 | Tablet | Notes |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| mob-01 | Homepage + hero callback | ✅ | ✅ | Visual specs cover both viewports. |
| mob-02 | `/pricing`, `/contact` | ✅ | ✅ | Same. |
| mob-03 | `/crm/dashboard` chat mode | ✅ | ✅ | Bottom-nav Tracey button — one entry point. |
| mob-04 | `/crm/inbox` composer | ✅ | 🟡 | Tablet split-view unverified. |
| mob-05 | `/crm/deals` kanban | 🟡 | 🟡 | Kanban drag fix landed (crm-19); mobile touch-drag usability not separately tested. |
| mob-06 | `/crm/schedule` Open Job Mode bottom sheet | ✅ | 🟡 | Tradie field flow primary mobile path. |
| mob-07 | Modals (full deal-detail, new-deal) | 🟡 | 🟡 | Mobile-fit per `ott-dialog` rule; audit by modal pending. |
| mob-08 | Settings index + 22 subroutes | ✅ | 🟡 | `SettingsIndexMobile` renders 10 icon+subtitle rows; desktop sidebar already grouped. See logic-18. |

## X. Action items (rollup of every 🔴 / ⬜)

In approximate fix-priority order. Each lands with the test that
would have caught it (rule below).

17. ✅ **pub-01 / pub-06** — Portal audit trail exists; **FIXED 2026-05-25** `__tests__/sms-intro-portal-link.test.ts` asserts portal URL in intro SMS body and activity log. acq-09 verified via `contact-route.test.ts`.
18. ✅ **comm-17** — Booking-confirmation WebhookEvents recorded; ops queried via feature-verification.ts.
19. 🟡 **comm-20** — WhatsApp route well-tested (4 scenarios in `__tests__/whatsapp-route.test.ts`); live round-trip synthetic outstanding.
20. ✅ **res-01, res-02, res-04, res-05** — FIXED 2026-05-25: Stripe timeout (billing-actions test), Stripe retry idempotency (stripe-webhook test), Twilio retryWithBackoff, LLM error fallback (ai-agent test). res-07 (DB pool) and res-08 (cron watchdog) noted as infrastructure gaps.

23. ✅ **logic-20** — `loading.tsx` audited; missing `return` fixed in `crm/loading.tsx`.

## Y. Execution rules (do not skip)

These are the rules every PR is held to. They are the reason the
matrix is worth maintaining.

1. **Every PR updates this matrix.** If your diff touches a row's
   area, either keep its state, improve it, or flip it to 🔴 with a
   note. Reviewers reject PRs that silently degrade rows.
2. **Every bug fix lands with the test that would have caught it.**
   The test goes in the matrix row's *Proof* column.
3. **Pre-release smoke pass.** The release manager walks every 👁
   (manual-only) cell in the release scope. Anything 🔴 is a blocker
   unless explicitly accepted in writing.
4. **Quarterly cull.** Walk every ⬜ row. Decide: build it or remove
   from the matrix. Backlog rot is worse than honest gaps.
5. **A row cannot be ✅ if it violates a `CLAUDE.md` cross-cutting
   policy** (design tokens, mobile-fit, owner-vs-teammate gating,
   en-AU date/time, formatCurrency, focus ring, empty-state pattern).
   Drop to 🟡 and link the violated policy in *Notes*.
6. **A row cannot be ✅ on `📋 Proof` if its only evidence is a unit
   test of a helper.** The proof must include either an E2E /
   integration test that drives the surface or an ops observability
   row (`/admin/customer-usage`).

## Z. Change log

- **2026-05-25 (continued)** — pub-06 verified: `__tests__/sms-intro-portal-link.test.ts`
  asserts portal URL in intro SMS + activity log. acq-09 promoted to verified:
  `contact-route.test.ts` already asserts `[Contact – sales]` email subject prefix.
- **2026-05-24** — Audit: cpl-01 (STOP), cpl-02 (Twilio leak),
  notif-01..03 (decorative email prefs), bill-10 (no grace period),
  logic-01..20 (coherence problems). Three Playwright stubs added.
  Matrix consolidated with `JOURNEY_ACCEPTANCE.md` 8-check framework.
  Folded prose from `docs/CRITICAL_USER_JOURNEYS.md` and
  `docs/use_case_walkthroughs.md` into per-row notes.
