## Module 1: 🚀 Quick Start Guide
*Focus: Getting from "Zero to First Job" in 15 minutes.*

### 1.1 Initial Setup & Business Profile
**📍 Where it is:** `Settings` (bottom of the left menu) > `Workspace`
When you first log in, tell Pj Buddy about your business.
*   **Business Name & Trade**: What do you do? (e.g., Plumbing, Electrical).
*   **Business Hours**: When do you work? This tells the AI when to schedule jobs.
*   **Service Area**: How far are you willing to travel?

### 1.2 Understanding the Dashboard Layout
**📍 Where it is:** `Home` (top of the left menu)
The dashboard is your main control center. It has three main parts:
1.  **Left Sidebar:** Use this to jump between pages (Home, Calendar, Inbox, etc.).
2.  **Middle Screen:** This is where you do your work (like moving jobs around on the board).
3.  **Right Panel:** Your AI Assistant is always here, ready to help you via chat!

### 1.3 Navigation & The Sidebar
**📍 Where it is:** The dark menu on the left side of your screen.
Think of the sidebar as your remote control:
*   🏠 **Home:** See all your jobs.
*   📅 **Schedule:** See your calendar.
*   ✉️ **Inbox:** Read your text messages and emails.
*   ⚙️ **Settings:** Change how Pj Buddy works.

### 1.4 Your First AI Command
**📍 Where it is:** The chat box on the right side of the screen.
You don't have to click buttons if you don't want to! Just tell the AI what to do.

*   Press Enter, and the AI will create the job for you magically!

### 1.5 Global Search (Cmd+K)
**📍 Where it is:** Your keyboard! Press `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows).

## Module 2: 💼 Managing Jobs & Deals
*Focus: The core revenue engine—tracking work from lead to payment.*

### 2.1 The Kanban Board Explained
**📍 Where it is:** `Home` page
The main screen is a "Kanban board" (columns that jobs move through).
*   🔵 **New Request:** Brand new jobs.
*   🟣 **Quote Sent:** You told them the price, waiting for a YES.
*   🟡 **Scheduled:** On the calendar.
*   🟠 **Pipeline:** You're doing the work now.
*   🔴 **Ready to Invoice:** Work is done, time to get paid!
*   🟢 **Completed:** Paid and finished.

### 2.2 Creating a New Deal (Manual vs. AI)
**📍 Where it is:** `Home` page (Click "+ New Deal" at the top right) OR the AI Chat panel.
*   **Manual:** Click the big "+ New Deal" button, fill in the customer's name and what the job is, and click "Save".
*   **AI:** Type in the chat: *"New job for Sarah, fixing the roof, quote is $500"*.

### 2.3 Managing Stages (Drag & Drop)
**📍 Where it is:** `Home` page
Moving a job is as easy as grabbing it with your mouse. Click and hold a job card, drag it to the next column (like from "New Request" to "Scheduled"), and let go!

### 2.4 Deal Details & Financials
**📍 Where it is:** Click on any Job Card on the `Home` page.
When you click a job, a window pops up with all the details. Here you can change the price, add private notes, or see the customer's contact info.

### 2.5 Handling Stale & Rotting Deals
**📍 Where it is:** Look for warning colors on your job cards on the `Home` page.
If you forget about a job, Pj Buddy remembers! Unattended jobs will highlight themselves so you know they are going "stale". Click on them to send a quick follow-up message!

### 2.6 Quotes & Invoicing
**📍 Where it is:** Inside a Job Card -> "Invoices" tab.
You can draft a quote or an invoice straight from the job details. The AI can even help draft the description so it looks professional!

### 3.3 Drag-and-Drop Rescheduling
**📍 Where it is:** `Schedule` page
Schedule changed? No problem. Just click, hold, and drag the calendar block to a new day or time! 

### 3.4 AI Availability Checking
**📍 Where it is:** AI Chat panel on the right.
Don't want to look at the calendar? Just ask the AI! Type: *"When am I free next Tuesday?"* and it will read your calendar and tell you.

### 3.5 Handling Conflicts
**📍 Where it is:** `Schedule` page
If you accidentally double-book yourself, the system will warn you with a red alert or the AI will tell you there's a conflict when you ask it to schedule something.

# Module 12: Latency Telemetry (Admin Operations)

Use this when diagnosing slow AI responses.

## Endpoint Access
- `GET /api/internal/telemetry/latency`
- `DELETE /api/internal/telemetry/latency` to clear rolling samples.

In production, include:
- Header: `x-telemetry-key`
- Value: `TELEMETRY_ADMIN_KEY`

## Key Metrics
- Web chat:
  - `chat.web.preprocessing_ms`
  - `chat.web.tool_calls_ms`
  - `chat.web.model_ms`
  - `chat.web.total_ms`
- Headless agent:
  - `chat.headless.preprocessing_ms`
  - `chat.headless.tool_calls_ms`
  - `chat.headless.model_ms`
  - `chat.headless.total_ms`
- Per tool:
  - `chat.web.tool.<tool_name>_ms`
  - `chat.headless.tool.<tool_name>_ms`

## How to Read
- `p50Ms`: typical latency.
- `p95Ms`: tail latency (bad-user-experience zone).
- If `tool_calls_ms` is high, optimize tools/query paths.
- If `model_ms` is high, optimize prompt size/model/tool-step budget.
- If `preprocessing_ms` is high, optimize context/memory/extraction work.
