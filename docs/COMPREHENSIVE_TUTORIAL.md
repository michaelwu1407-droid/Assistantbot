## Module 1: 🚀 Quick Start Guide
*Focus: Getting from "Zero to First Job" in 15 minutes.*

### 1.1 Initial Setup & Business Profile
**📍 Where it is:** `Settings` (bottom of the left menu) > `Workspace`
When you first log in, tell Pj Buddy about your business.
*   **Business Name & Trade**: What do you do? (e.g., Plumbing, Electrical).
*   **Business Hours**: When do you work? This tells the AI when to schedule jobs.
*   **Service Area**: How far are you willing to travel?

### 1.2 Understanding the Dashboard Layout
**📍 Where it is:** `Home` (top of the left menu)
The dashboard is your main control center. It has three main parts:
1.  **Left Sidebar:** Use this to jump between pages (Home, Calendar, Inbox, etc.).
2.  **Middle Screen:** This is where you do your work (like moving jobs around on the board).
3.  **Right Panel:** Your AI Assistant is always here, ready to help you via chat!

### 1.3 Navigation & The Sidebar
**📍 Where it is:** The dark menu on the left side of your screen.
Think of the sidebar as your remote control:
*   🏠 **Home:** See all your jobs.
*   📅 **Schedule:** See your calendar.
*   ✉️ **Inbox:** Read your text messages and emails.
*   ⚙️ **Settings:** Change how Pj Buddy works.

### 1.4 Your First AI Command
**📍 Where it is:** The chat box on the right side of the screen.
You don't have to click buttons if you don't want to! Just tell the AI what to do.
*   **Try typing:** *"Create a new job for John for a leaky tap, $150"*
*   Press Enter, and the AI will create the job for you magically!

### 1.5 Global Search (Cmd+K)
**📍 Where it is:** Your keyboard! Press `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows).
Can't find something? Press this shortcut anywhere in the app to open a search bar. Type a customer's name, phone number, or job title to find it instantly.
