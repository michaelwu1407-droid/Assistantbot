- Why: Match requested marketing copy update.

### 2026-03-05 02:14 (AEDT) - codex

### 2026-03-05 02:13 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`
- What changed: Updated bottom headline copy to `Give yourself an early mark today` with green-highlighted `early mark`; replaced the old `The old way` / `The Tracey way` flow cards with a side-by-side comparison layout matching the reference style, removed emoji labels, renamed RHS heading to `Tracey does it for you`, and inserted the exact requested grouped bullet content for both columns using crosses on the old-way side.
- Why: Match requested copy and transform the comparison section into a cleaner visual format consistent with the provided reference.

### 2026-03-05 02:00 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`, `components/layout/navbar.tsx`
- What changed: Refined hero value pillars to a sleeker integrated strip style and removed numeric markers; set the CRM/interview section to dark grey background for contrast; added bottom CTA headline `Give your self an Earlymark today` with green-highlighted `Earlymark` and applied green ambient glow to that section; normalized top navbar text/button sizing to `text-[15px]` for consistency.
- Why: Improve visual cohesion and contrast across sections while matching requested copy and hierarchy.

### 2026-03-05 01:46 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`, `app/contact/page.tsx`
- What changed: Updated bottom CTA buttons to `Get started` and `Get a demo`; changed `Get a demo` link target to `/contact#contact-form`; added `id="contact-form"` to the contact page form for direct deep-linking.
- Why: Match requested CTA wording and ensure demo CTA opens directly at the contact form.

### 2026-03-05 01:44 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`
- What changed: Reworked the "Hire Tracey today" block into a 2-column layout with `Tracey in action` (video/demo) on the left and the 3 feature boxes on the right. Updated the third feature card to title `AI that actually works` and description `AI that handles convos like a human. Tracey learns your preferences and delivers a better and simpler experience.`
- Why: Match requested section structure and exact final card copy.

### 2026-03-05 01:41 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`
- What changed: Updated hero CTA labels to `Get started` and `Interview your assistant` (with interview anchor link), changed CRM section headline copy to remove "for you", added `id=\"interview-assistant\"`, and removed the placeholder platform video block so the section is now LHS text and RHS interview form.
- Why: Match requested CTA wording and restructure the CRM/interview section to text + form only.

### 2026-03-05 01:35 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`
- What changed: Replaced center-only hero glow with a reference-style layered background treatment: soft full-section gradient field, lower horizontal green halo, and angled side atmospheric panels to mirror the reference composition in green.
- Why: Match the reference look more closely and avoid the "single center glow" appearance.

### 2026-03-05 01:33 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`
- What changed: Reworked hero glow rendering from negative-z blurred circles to an in-section layered radial-gradient glow (`z-0`) and moved hero content to `z-10` with `isolate` to guarantee visibility.
- Why: Fix non-visible ambient glow caused by stacking context; ensure a clearly visible green glow behind hero content.

### 2026-03-05 01:31 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `components/layout/navbar.tsx`
- What changed: Restored the `Contact us` CTA in the top navbar and linked it to `/contact`.

### 2026-03-05 01:29 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`
- What changed: Refined hero value cards for clearer visual hierarchy: added an "Earlymark helps businesses" label, replaced plain `(1)(2)(3)` text markers with numbered badges, applied consistent dark gradient cards, and tightened typography/spacing for better readability.
- Why: Fix poor formatting and produce a cleaner, higher-contrast hero value section aligned with the requested content.

### 2026-03-05 01:25 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`
- What changed: Removed the hero paragraph text, moved the three dark labelled value boxes `(1)(2)(3)` directly beneath the hero heading, and significantly amplified the green ambient radial glow with three stronger layered glows.
- Why: Match requested hero hierarchy and make the green glow unmistakably visible.

### 2026-03-05 01:17 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `app/page.tsx`
- What changed: Updated hero visuals by increasing a clearly green ambient radial glow and replaced the existing value pillar cards with three dark horizontal boxes labelled `(1)`, `(2)`, `(3)` containing the exact requested lines.
- Why: Match the requested hero design direction and restore the original messaging structure in a stronger, higher-contrast format.

### 2026-03-05 01:16 (AEDT) - codex
- Files: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent_change_log.md`, `.husky/pre-commit`, `scripts/check-agent-change-log.mjs`

- Why: Enforce a reliable audit trail so agent-made edits are always documented.
