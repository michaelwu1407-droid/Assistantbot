# Instructions for This User

- **Assume no coding background.** Do not assume familiarity with terms like "terminal," "repo," "dependency," or "node."
- **Be step-by-step.** Give short, numbered steps. Say exactly what to click, type, or open.
- **Use plain language.** Avoid jargon; when a technical term is needed, explain it in simple words.
- **One thing at a time.** Prefer one action per step so it never feels overwhelming.
